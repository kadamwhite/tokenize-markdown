# This is a markdown file

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>It has an HTML code block</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

```js
console.log( 'it also has a "js" codeblock' );
```

```javascript
// Not to be left out in the cold, it also has
var aCodeBlock = 'of language "javascript"';
```

As you can see by the above, Markdown is a pretty useful thing.
